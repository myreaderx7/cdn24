The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only.<\/p>\n<p>Real estate investor <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sweatystartup\">Nick Huber<\/a> is the first to <a href=\"https:\/\/hotline.co\/nick-huber-ama\">publicly try out the product<\/a> with a livestream today that began at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET). Huber represents the sort of creator Facebook wants to work with for Hotline, Facebook told us, which is someone who helps people expand their professional skills or their finances. In Huber&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s talking about investing in industrial real estate as a second income stream.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are live! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/sDA5fQNxJ3\">https:\/\/t.co\/sDA5fQNxJ3<\/a><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&mdash; Nick Huber (@sweatystartup) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sweatystartup\/status\/1379841706112253959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>At Facebook, Hotline is being led by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/erik-hazzard-4013038\/\">Eric Hazzard<\/a>, who joined Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run\/\">when it acquired his app tbh<\/a>, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app that grew to 2.5 million daily active users in nine weeks and saw over 1 billion poll answers before exiting. With Hotline, Hazzard is once again developing a product in the Q&amp;A space.<\/p>\n<p>But this time, the new app is taking inspiration from an up-and-coming social network, Clubhouse. In fact, Hotline&#8217;s user interface will look familiar to anyone who&#8217;s already used Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces or any of the other audio-only social networks, when it&#8217;s viewed on mobile. At the top on mobile (or to the left side on desktop), there&#8217;s a speaker section where the event host is featured in a round profile icon or live video stream. Below (or to the side on desktop) are the event&#8217;s listeners.<\/p>\n<p>But there are also several differences between Hotline and existing apps, like Clubhouse.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2135237\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2135237\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2135237\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Hotline-GIF.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"375\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2135237\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Facebook<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>For starters, the app today has users sign in with Twitter then verify their identity via SMS.<\/p>\n<p>The listeners&#8217; section, for example, is divided up between those who are just watching the event, as represented by their profile icons, and those who are asking questions. At the top of this section, you&#8217;re presented with the lists of questions that users have asked, which others can upvote or downvote accordingly. The creator can then look to this section to find out which questions to answer next and can pull listeners onto the stage area with them for a conversation.<\/p>\n<p>At present, users can type in their questions, then join the host &#8220;on stage,&#8221; when it&#8217;s their turn. Currently, guests are represented by their profile icon and are audio only when on stage. But in the settings, there&#8217;s an option for the listener to toggle on video that&#8217;s not yet functional for today&#8217;s test.<\/p>\n<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2135260\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2135260\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2135260\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg 3286w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=768,396 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=1536,793 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1057 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2135260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hotline<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Hosts have full control over the experience, and can remove inappropriate questions from the queue or remove people from their Hotline session.

This, Clubhouse believes, allows participants to speak more freely and with less fear. But Hotline automatically produces recordings. After the event, the host will receive two recordings of the session &#8212; one as an mp3 and another as an mp4. The creator can then upload these to other networks, like YouTube or Facebook, edit them into short-form content for apps like TikTok or turn the audio recording into a podcast, or anything else.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, anyone can join a Hotline for free and there&#8217;s no limit on audience size, though this could change as the experiment progresses.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the similarities with Clubhouse, Hotline has a different vibe because of its use of video, text-based questions, upvoting and because it&#8217;s recorded. This makes it feel less like a casual hangout and more like a professional event where an expert is leading a session and inviting an audience to ask questions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"S6CVeYvStX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps\/\">Facebook launches BARS, a TikTok-like app for creating and sharing raps<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook launches BARS, a TikTok-like app for creating and sharing raps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps\/embed\/#?secret=S6CVeYvStX\" data-secret=\"S6CVeYvStX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Hotline <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">is now one of several apps that Facebook&#8217;s NPE team has launched in the creator space to experiment with different ideas around audio and video.

Partner Leah Solivan joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021 to talk about how to avoid early mistakes in building your startup. Solivan has ample experience on both sides of the fence, as she founded TaskRabbit and led it to exit through an acquisition by Ikea in 2017. She shared a list of 10 things to avoid in total, but here are some highlights of what to watch out for.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Share your ideas freely<\/h2>\n<p>Solivan urged founders to not be shy about sharing their ideas, as some people can tend to be secretive about their startup concept. The notion that giving up your idea somehow means you&#8217;ll end up with more competition is not a legitimate concern in the end, Solivan said. Instead, sharing that idea with as many people as you can is much more likely to generate positive results than negative.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I would be giving a presentation. And someone after the presentation would come up to me and say, oh my goodness, I had this same idea for TaskRabbit, like 10 years ago. And I&#8217;d be like, great! What did you do with that idea?

today launched its latest experiment, <a href=\"https:\/\/hotline.co\/\">Hotline<\/a>, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only.<\/p>\n<p>Real estate investor <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sweatystartup\">Nick Huber<\/a> is the first to <a href=\"https:\/\/hotline.co\/nick-huber-ama\">publicly try out the product<\/a> with a livestream today that began at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET). Huber represents the sort of creator Facebook wants to work with for Hotline, Facebook told us, which is someone who helps people expand their professional skills or their finances. In Huber&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s talking about investing in industrial real estate as a second income stream.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are live! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/sDA5fQNxJ3\">https:\/\/t.co\/sDA5fQNxJ3<\/a><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&mdash; Nick Huber (@sweatystartup) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sweatystartup\/status\/1379841706112253959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>At Facebook, Hotline is being led by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/erik-hazzard-4013038\/\">Eric Hazzard<\/a>, who joined Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run\/\">when it acquired his app tbh<\/a>, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app that grew to 2.5 million daily active users in nine weeks and saw over 1 billion poll answers before exiting. With Hotline, Hazzard is once again developing a product in the Q&amp;A space.<\/p>\n<p>But this time, the new app is taking inspiration from an up-and-coming social network, Clubhouse. In fact, Hotline&#8217;s user interface will look familiar to anyone who&#8217;s already used Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces or any of the other audio-only social networks, when it&#8217;s viewed on mobile. At the top on mobile (or to the left side on desktop), there&#8217;s a speaker section where the event host is featured in a round profile icon or live video stream. Below (or to the side on desktop) are the event&#8217;s listeners.<\/p>\n<p>But there are also several differences between Hotline and existing apps, like Clubhouse.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2135237\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2135237\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2135237\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Hotline-GIF.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"375\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2135237\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Facebook<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>For starters, the app today has users sign in with Twitter then verify their identity via SMS.<\/p>\n<p>The listeners&#8217; section, for example, is divided up between those who are just watching the event, as represented by their profile icons, and those who are asking questions. At the top of this section, you&#8217;re presented with the lists of questions that users have asked, which others can upvote or downvote accordingly. The creator can then look to this section to find out which questions to answer next and can pull listeners onto the stage area with them for a conversation.<\/p>\n<p>At present, users can type in their questions, then join the host &#8220;on stage,&#8221; when it&#8217;s their turn. Currently, guests are represented by their profile icon and are audio only when on stage. But in the settings, there&#8217;s an option for the listener to toggle on video that&#8217;s not yet functional for today&#8217;s test.<\/p>\n<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2135260\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2135260\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2135260\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg 3286w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=768,396 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=1536,793 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1057 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.03.41-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2135260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hotline<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Hosts have full control over the experience, and can remove inappropriate questions from the queue or remove people from their Hotline session.

This, Clubhouse believes, allows participants to speak more freely and with less fear. But Hotline automatically produces recordings. After the event, the host will receive two recordings of the session &#8212; one as an mp3 and another as an mp4. The creator can then upload these to other networks, like YouTube or Facebook, edit them into short-form content for apps like TikTok or turn the audio recording into a podcast, or anything else.<\/p>\n<p>At launch, anyone can join a Hotline for free and there&#8217;s no limit on audience size, though this could change as the experiment progresses.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the similarities with Clubhouse, Hotline has a different vibe because of its use of video, text-based questions, upvoting and because it&#8217;s recorded.

unicorn Kavak raises a $485M Series D at a $4B valuation."},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kavak.com\/\">Kavak<\/a>, the Mexican startup that\u2019s disrupted the used car market in Mexico and Argentina, today announced its Series D of $485 million, which now values the company at $4 billion. This round more than triples their previous valuation of $1.15 billion, which established them as a unicorn just a couple of months ago in October of 2020. Kavak is now one of the top five highest-valued startups in Latin America.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The round was led by D1 Capital Partners, Founders Fund, Ribbit, and BOND, and brings Kavak\u2019s total capital raised to date to more than $900 million. Kavak recently soft-launched in Brazil, and this new round of funding will be used to build out the Brazilian market and beyond, said Carlos Garc\u00eda Ottati, Kavak\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder. The company plans to do a full launch in Brazil in the next 60 days, Garc\u00eda said, and we can expect to see Kavak in markets outside Latin America in the next 24 months, he added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were built to solve emerging market problems,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavak, which was founded in 2016, is an online marketplace that aims to bring transparency, security, and access to financing to the used car market. The company also offers its own financing through its fintech arm, Kavak Capital, and counts more than 2,500 employees and 20 logistics and reconditioning hubs in Mexico and Argentina.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn Latin America, 90% of the [used car] transactions are informal, which leads to a 40% fraud rate,\u201d said Garc\u00eda, who experienced these challenges first-hand when he moved to Mexico from Colombia a couple of years ago and bought a used car.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy budget allowed me to buy a used car, but there was no infrastructure around it. It took me 6 months to buy the car, and then the car had legal and mechanical issues and I lost most of my money,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavak buys cars from individuals, refurbishes them, and offers warranties to buyers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cInstead of buying a new car, they can buy a better car that still has all the warranties. It\u2019s a really aspirational process,\u201d said Garc\u00eda. The company, which really amounts to four companies in one given its areas of focus, was built to be comprehensive by design in order to meet the various gaps in the market, Garc\u00eda said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re building a business here [Latin America], you need to build several businesses because so many things are broken,\u201d he said. That&#8217;s why the financing option, for example, has been a key to their success, according to Garc\u00eda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financing has traditionally been hard to come by in Brazil, and as Garc\u00eda said, the used car market lacks infrastructure there, too. That being said, Brazil is Latin America\u2019s fintech hub, and the space has made leaps and bounds over the last 7-10 years with companies such as Nubank, PagSeguro, Creditas, PicPay, and others leading the way.

There are many creative immigration pathways for you, your co-founder and your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/opt-optional-practical-training\/\">F-1 OPT<\/a> employee to explore. We\u2019ll take a look at several options, and you can also check out my recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/podcast\/065-selected-or-not-selected-in-the-h-1b-lottery-now-what\/\">podcast<\/a> in which my colleague <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nadia-zaidi-b3a40414\/\">Nadia Zaidi<\/a> and I explain them in greater depth.<\/p>\n<p>I hope the below ideas inspire you and fill you with a sense of hope and possibility. As always, I suggest consulting with an experienced immigration attorney who can help you identify the strongest path forward, as well as backup options for your co-founder and employee. The particular immigration strategy that\u2019s best for you is always an individual determination. It\u2019s best identified through a personal consultation with an attorney such as myself based on a variety of factors, including each person\u2019s immigration history and your particular startup\u2019s goals.<\/p>\n<h2>Co-founder immigration options<\/h2>\n<p>For a funded startup, there\u2019s a great H-1B Plan B: the Cap-Exempt H-1B. Especially if your co-founder has a STEM background (and possibly even for some founders who don\u2019t have this), there\u2019s a wonderful new triple-win option that supports startups, international candidates and even diverse U.S. STEM college students seeking better project-based learning opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>What is this magical rainbow-striped unicorn option, you ask? Well, here\u2019s the legal background: Some employers qualify to petition for an H-1B visa at any time without going through the lottery. These employers \u2014 called cap-exempt employers because they are not subject to the annual H-1B cap of 85,000 visas available to for-profit employers \u2014 include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Institutions of higher education.<\/li>\n<li>Nonprofits tied to institutions of higher education.<\/li>\n<li>Nonprofit research organizations.<\/li>\n<li>Government research organizations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your co-founder can get a part-time H-1B visa through one of these cap-exempt employers, your startup can concurrently sponsor your co-founder for an H-1B regardless of the recent lottery results.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100312\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2100312\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg\" alt=\"A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Joanna Buniak \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sophie Alcorn <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>To take advantage of this special law, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openavenuesfoundation.org\/\">Open Avenues Foundation<\/a>, which offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openavenuesfoundation.org\/global-talent\">Global Talent Fellowship<\/a>. In this program, international talent can receive cap-exempt H-1B visas by leading university students for about five hours a week in real-world, project-based work within their field of expertise for the startup that nominated them for the fellowship. The candidate gets to stay in (or come to) the U.S., your startup gets a team of students working on a group project that benefits your company and increases diversity in your hiring pipeline, and U.S. students get the benefit of hands-on high quality STEM learning.<\/p>\n<p>Once your candidate\u2019s first cap-exempt H-1B is in place, your startup can petition for a second, concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1B for direct startup employment.<\/p>\n<p>Interested in variations? If you\u2019re not in STEM but have a university that would host you (free to the university), you can potentially partner with OAF. In addition, many universities in the U.S have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globaleir.org\/\">global entrepreneur-in-residence programs<\/a> that can help international co-founders qualify for concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1Bs. Your startup should also consider sponsoring your co-founder for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/immigration\/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp\/\">O-1A visa<\/a> or change of status.<\/p>\n<p>Another option to consider is for your co-founder to apply for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/entrepreneur-parole\/\">International Entrepreneur Parole<\/a> (IEP), a new 30-month immigration status in the U.S. The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) was created by President Barack Obama and is the closest thing the U.S. has right now to a startup visa. The Trump administration tried to eliminate it, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/nvca.org\/immigration\/\">National Venture Capital Association<\/a>, led by Jeff Farrah, successfully challenged the administration\u2019s effort in federal court, so IEP remains on the books.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of folks don\u2019t believe it\u2019s an option yet, so I\u2019m currently looking for international startup founders with a strong case to file for IEP to test out this new program and demonstrate its existence to the world. We\u2019re currently seeking global startup founders holding at least 15% equity in a U.S. startup that\u2019s less than five years old and has raised at least $250,000 from U.S. investors. If you want to be on our free interest list, you can fill out this <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLScmpTCXBjdaZkGF_fMlEnDVdmD114lm8pH9R24iOKaE1znwEQ\/viewform\">form<\/a>. If we think you have a strong application, we\u2019ll reach out.<\/p>\n<p>If your co-founder wants to remain permanently in the U.S., consider starting a green card now such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/immigration\/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp\/\">EB-1A<\/a> green card for individuals of extraordinary ability or an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/immigration\/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp\/\">EB-2 NIW<\/a> (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals of exceptional ability. Of these, the EB-1A is the quickest option, but its qualification requirements are tougher than for the EB-2 NIW.<\/p>\n<h2>F-1 OPT employee immigration options<\/h2>\n<p>If your F-1 OPT employee graduated with a qualified STEM degree, that employee can apply for a 24-month work extension, known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/stem-opt-extension\/\">STEM OPT<\/a>. That will allow the employee to remain in the U.S. to continue working for you. In the meantime, you can register them again next year for the H-1B lottery. If there\u2019s no possibility for STEM, please check out the Cap-Exempt H-1B option explained above.<\/p>\n<p>If your F-1 OPT employee only has a bachelor\u2019s degree, they might want to consider pursuing an advanced degree. Individuals with a master\u2019s or higher degree from a U.S. university have better odds of being selected in the annual H-1B lottery. That\u2019s because 20,000 of the 85,000 H-1B visas available each year are earmarked for individuals with a master\u2019s or higher degree from a U.S. university.<\/p>\n<p>You should be aware, however, that next year\u2019s H-1B lottery will likely shift from the current random selection process to one based on the highest wages. Unless the Biden administration changes the policy, which was devised by the previous administration, employers who pay their H-1B candidates a Level III wage or higher have the best chance of getting selected to file for an H-1B visa.<\/p>\n<p>As you know, sponsoring employers must agree to pay an H-1B candidate the higher of either the actual wage paid for the job or the prevailing wage, which is broken down into four levels based on experience required for the position and location of the position. Level I wage is basically for an entry-level position, while a Level IV wage is for a position requiring the most experience. While this will add greater predictability to the annual H-1B \u201clottery,\u201d early-stage startups and small businesses may have a difficult time competing against more established companies on salary, particularly because stock options and equity are not included in the salary calculation.<\/p>\n<p>If you need to find alternative visa solutions, you can always consult with an attorney. I hope all of these options help you realize the control and agency you have in this situation. You have choices!<\/p>\n<p>All my best,<\/p>\n<p>Sophie<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Have a question for Sophie? <a href=\"https:\/\/webforms.pipedrive.com\/f\/1FRtXDHbec94FLVsSrWoOE362FDjgK7JkmZmK9g2IiOhbJLDMHtEAapwnHIfqC89l\">Ask it here<\/a>.

But the timeline of the incident looks increasingly awkward for the tech giant.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u00a0initially sought to play down the data breach revelations published by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4\">Business Insider<\/a> at the weekend by suggesting that information like people&#8217;s birth dates and phone numbers was &#8220;old&#8221;, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/04\/facts-on-news-reports-about-facebook-data\/\">blog post<\/a> late yesterday the tech giant finally revealed that the data in question had in fact been scraped from its platform by malicious actors &#8220;in 2019&#8221; and &#8220;prior to September 2019&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>That new detail about the timing of this incident raises the issue of compliance with Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which came into application in May 2018.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Under the EU regulation data controllers can face fines of up to 2% of their global annual turnover for failures to notify breaches, and up to 4% of annual turnover for more serious compliance violations.<\/p>\n<p>The European framework looks important because\u00a0Facebook indemnified itself against historical privacy issues in the US when it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/24\/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees\/\">settled with the FTC for $5BN back in July 2019<\/a> &#8212; although that does still mean there&#8217;s a period of several months (June to September 2019) which could fall outside that settlement.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not only is <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Facebook<\/a> past the indemnification period of the FTC settlement (June 12 2019), they also may have violated the terms of the settlement requiring them to report breaches of covered information (ht <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JustinBrookman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinBrookman<\/a> ) <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/182LEf4rNO\">https:\/\/t.co\/182LEf4rNO<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/utCnQ4USHI\">pic.twitter.com\/utCnQ4USHI<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ashk4n\/status\/1379595482175954946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach\/\">Yesterday<\/a>, in its own statement responding to the breach revelations, Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU said the provenance of the newly published dataset wasn&#8217;t entirely clear, writing that it &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset&#8221; &#8212; referring to an earlier breach incident Facebook disclosed in 2018 which related to a vulnerability in its phone lookup functionality that it had said occurred between June 2017 and April 2018 &#8212; but also writing that the newly published dataset also looked to have been &#8220;combined with additional records, which may be from a later period&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Facebook followed up the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC)&#8217;s statement by confirming that suspicion &#8212; admitting that the data had been extracted from its platform in 2019, up until September of that year.<\/p>\n<p>Another new detail that emerged in Facebook&#8217;s blog post yesterday was the fact users&#8217; data was scraped not via the aforementioned phone lookup vulnerability &#8212; but via another method altogether: A contact importer tool vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>This route allowed an unknown number of &#8220;malicious actors&#8221; to use software to imitate Facebook&#8217;s app and upload large sets of phone numbers to see which ones matched Facebook users.<\/p>\n<p>In this way a spammer (for example), could upload a database of potential phone numbers and link them to not only names but other data like birth date, email address, location &#8212; all the better to phish you with.<\/p>\n<p>In its PR response to the breach, Facebook quickly claimed it had fixed this vulnerability in August 2019. But, again, that timing places the incident squarely in the period of GDPR being active.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, Europe&#8217;s data protection framework bakes in a data breach notification regime that requires data controllers to notify a relevant supervisory authority if they believe a loss of personal data is likely to constitute a risk to users&#8217; rights and freedoms &#8212; and to do so without undue delay (ideally within 72 hours of becoming aware of it).<\/p>\n<p>Yet Facebook made <em>no disclosure at all of this incident to the DPC<\/em>. Indeed, the regulator made it clear yesterday that it had to <em>proactively<\/em> <em>seek information from Facebook<\/em> in the wake of BI&#8217;s report. That&#8217;s the opposite of how EU lawmakers intended the regulation to function.<\/p>\n<p>Data breaches, meanwhile, are broadly defined under the GDPR. It could mean personal data being lost or stolen and\/or accessed by unauthorized third parties. It can also relate to deliberate or accidental action or inaction by a data controller which exposes personal data.<\/p>\n<p>Legal risk attached to the breach likely explains why Facebook has studiously avoided describing this latest data protection failure, in which the personal information of more than half a billion users was posted for free download on an online forum, as a &#8216;breach&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>And, indeed, why it&#8217;s sought to downplay the significance of the leaked information &#8212; dubbing people&#8217;s personal information &#8220;old data&#8221;. (Even as few people regularly change their mobile numbers, email address, full names and biographical information and so on, and no one (legally) gets a new birth date&#8230; )<\/p>\n<p>Its blog post instead refers to data being scraped; and to scraping being &#8220;a common tactic that often relies on automated software to lift public information from the internet that can end up being distributed in online forums&#8221; &#8212; tacitly implying that the personal information leaked via its contact importer tool was somehow <em>public<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The self-serving suggestion being peddled here by Facebook is that hundreds of millions of users had both published sensitive stuff like their mobile phone numbers on their Facebook profiles <em>and<\/em> left default settings on their accounts &#8212; thereby making this personal information &#8216;publicly available for scraping\/no longer private\/uncovered by data protection legislation&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>This is an argument as obviously absurd as it is viciously hostile to people&#8217;s rights and privacy. It&#8217;s also an argument that EU data protection regulators must quickly and definitively reject or be complicit in allowing Facebook (ab)use its market power to torch the very fundamental rights that regulators&#8217; sole purpose is to defend and uphold.<\/p>\n<p>Even if some Facebook users affected by this breach had their information exposed via the contact importer tool because they had not changed Facebook&#8217;s privacy-hostile defaults that still raises key questions of GPDR compliance &#8212; because the regulation also requires data controllers to adequately secure personal data and apply privacy by design and default.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook allowing hundreds of millions of accounts to have their info freely pillaged by spammers (or whoever) doesn&#8217;t sound like good security or default privacy.<\/p>\n<p>In short, it&#8217;s the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/23\/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails\/\">Cambridge Analytica scandal<\/a> all over again.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is trying to get away with continuing to be terrible at privacy and data protection because it&#8217;s been so terrible at it in the past &#8212; and likely feels confident in keeping on with this tactic because it&#8217;s faced relatively little regulatory sanction for an endless parade of data scandals. (A one-time $5BN FTC fine for a company than turns over $85BN+ in annual revenue is just another business expense.)<\/p>\n<p>We asked Facebook why it failed to notify the DPC about this 2019 breach back in 2019, when it realized people&#8217;s information was once again being maliciously extracted from its platform &#8212; or, indeed, why it hasn&#8217;t bothered to tell affected Facebook users themselves &#8212; but the company declined to comment beyond what it said yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>Then it told us it would not be commenting on its communications with regulators.<\/p>\n<p>Under the GDPR, if a breach poses a high risk to users&#8217; rights and freedoms a data controller is required to notify affected individuals &#8212; with the rational being that prompt notification of a threat can help people take steps to protect themselves from the risks of their data being breached, such as fraud and ID theft.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday Facebook also said it does not have plans to notify users either.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the company&#8217;s trademark &#8216;thumbs up&#8217; symbol would be more aptly expressed as a middle finger raised at everyone else.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"s0EndtQZu0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach\/\">Answers being sought from Facebook over latest data breach<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Answers being sought from Facebook over latest data breach&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach\/embed\/#?secret=s0EndtQZu0\" data-secret=\"s0EndtQZu0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hgNRE9i2lT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog\/\">Facebook&#8217;s secret settlement on Cambridge Analytica gags UK data watchdog<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s secret settlement on Cambridge Analytica gags UK data watchdog&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog\/embed\/#?secret=hgNRE9i2lT\" data-secret=\"hgNRE9i2lT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The question of whether Facebook will face any regulatory sanction over the latest massive historical platform privacy fail to come to light remains unclear.

raises $12M to digitize the freight logistics industry"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Despite hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods flowing across the U.S.-Mexican border each year, the freight industry has remained analog \u2014 each side of the border offering up its own maze of bureaucracy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nuvocargo.com\/\">Nuvocargo<\/a>, a digital logistics platform for cross-border trade, is trying to modernize the process. The company offers an all-in-one service that rolls freight forwarding, customs brokerage, cargo insurance and even trade financing into one UI-friendly software and app. Housing all of these services under one app makes it easier for companies to track their supply chain and gives customs and logistics teams access to more centralized information, according to Nuvocargo CEO Deepak Chhugani.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And you just have one single audit trail in case something goes wrong,\u201d Chhugani told TechCrunch, adding that the process<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> helps reduce or eliminate the extra costs that come with a high administrative overhead. It also lets customers take a high-level look at their operations from within a single interface, he said.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Chhugani likened the experience to something like UberEats, which offers customers the ability to easily track food orders from restaurant to home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust imagine, because you are dealing with so many different parties, you lose visibility on what\u2019s going on. If you want a snapshot of \u2013 what did I spend end-to-end? \u2013 you actually have to go through all these email chains or faxes or texts with different providers,\u201d Chhugani explained. \u201cSome of them might be in another country. So [Nuvocargo] just creates more visibility throughout the process, from where the goods literally are to visibility around your finances.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Nuvocargo is thinking beyond the actual movement of goods. The company is also starting to offer customs brokerage, comprehensive cross-border cargo insurance, and factoring, or short-term account receivable finance. The last of these solves an especially difficult pain point for trucking companies, who sometimes must wait up to net-90 days to be paid.<\/p>\n<p>The approach has caught investors\u2019 eyes: nearly one year after announcing it had raised a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/23\/nuvocargo-a-trucking-managed-marketplace-raises-5-3m-in-seed-funding\/\">$5.3 million seed round<\/a>, the company has closed on a $12 million Series A funding led by QED Investors and with injections from David Velez, Michael Ronen, Raymond Tonsing, FJ Labs and Clocktower. Investors NFX and ALLVP, which participated in the previous round, also participated.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201choly grail\u201d of their new offerings, as Chhugani called it, is trade financing. Because Nuvocargo will already have a relationship with companies, including an understanding of credit and fraud risk, its hope is that it can offer financial products at a competitive rate.<\/p>\n<p>This is what attracted QED Investors, a firm that typically focuses on financial technology rather than logistics and trucking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter speaking with [Deepak] and seeing the connection points and parallels between what we were looking at in e-commerce and the challenges of actually getting goods across border, the fintech spark went off in my own head,\u201d Lauren Connolley Morton, a Partner at QED, said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe opportunities for factoring, for lending, for insuring goods are all very much right up our alley.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although Chhugani declined to disclose Nuvocargo\u2019s valuation after this most recent round of funding, it\u2019s clear there is plenty of room to grow into the logistics industry\u2019s huge and seemingly disaggregated value chain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Despite hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods flowing across the U.S.-Mexican border each year, the freight industry has remained analog \u2014 each side of the border offering up its own maze of bureaucracy.

This is an opportunity for us to stabilize these organizations to help them build their own capacities and capabilities so that that organization can be sustainable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resource is supported by a national coalition of funders committed to supporting entrepreneurs of color.

Partner Leah Solivan joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021 to talk about how to avoid early mistakes in building your startup. Solivan has ample experience on both sides of the fence, as she founded TaskRabbit and led it to exit through an acquisition by Ikea in 2017. She shared a list of 10 things to avoid in total, but here are some highlights of what to watch out for.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Share your ideas freely<\/h2>\n<p>Solivan urged founders to not be shy about sharing their ideas, as some people can tend to be secretive about their startup concept. The notion that giving up your idea somehow means you&#8217;ll end up with more competition is not a legitimate concern in the end, Solivan said. Instead, sharing that idea with as many people as you can is much more likely to generate positive results than negative.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I would be giving a presentation. And someone after the presentation would come up to me and say, oh my goodness, I had this same idea for TaskRabbit, like 10 years ago. And I&#8217;d be like, great! What did you do with that idea? And I think the point is, is that the idea itself isn&#8217;t the magic \u2014 the magic is in the execution of your idea and actually turning that idea into a business. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 01:42)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/03\/you-might-have-just-missed-the-best-time-to-sell-your-startup\/\">You might just have missed the best time to sell your startup<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/05\/15-things-founders-should-know-before-accepting-funding-from-a-corporate-vc\/\">15 things founders should know before accepting funding from a corporate VC<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Take everyone&#8217;s advice, but make the call<\/h2>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fuel Capital General Partner Leah Solivan joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021 to talk about how to avoid early mistakes in building your startup.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5302483,"featured_media":2134813,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"bcde70e0-a225-387e-868d-510362f49c90"},"categories":[20429,17396],"tags":[576846618,576871293,576860863],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796352],"tc_event":[576831922],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Leah-Solivan.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3wBv3GT","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.35,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":2080794,"authors":[5302483],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2134693"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2134693"}],"version-history":[{"count":17,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2134693\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2135295,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2134693\/revisions\/2135295"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/5302483"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2134693&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/5302483"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2134813"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2134693"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2134693"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2134693"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2134693"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2134693"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2134693"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2134693"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":5302483,"name":"Darrell Etherington","url":"","description":"Writer covering space, science and health tech.

This effect is now available to TikTok&#8217;s global user base and runs real-time beat tracking to animate a retro greenscreen landscape, the company says.<\/p>\n<p>The effect was added to TikTok&#8217;s Creative Effects tray yesterday and there are already over 28,000 videos created using the new feature.

may be in a unique position to develop tooling to help companies build machine learning applications. For starters, it developed an open source project, but today the startup announced an expanded beta of a new commercial offering and $35 million Series B funding.<\/p>\n<p>Sequoia led the investment with help from previous investors Gradient Ventures and GGV Capital. Today&#8217;s round brings the total raised to $62 million, according to the company.<\/p>\n<p>Data scientists can download the open source project and build a machine learning application, but it requires a certain level of technical aptitude to make all the parts work. Company co-founder and CEO Adrien Treuille\u00a0 says that so far the company has 20,000 monthly active developers using the open source tooling to develop streaming apps, which have been viewed millions of times.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As they have gained that traction, they have customers who would prefer to use a commercial service. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to have something free and that you can use instantly, but not every company is capable of bridging that into a commercial offering,&#8221; Treuille explained.<\/p>\n<p>Company COO and co-founder Amanda Kelly says that the commercial offering called Streamlit for Teams is designed to remove some of the complexity around using the open source application. &#8220;The whole [process of] how do I actually deploy an app, put it in a container, make sure it scales, has the resources and is securely connected to data sources [&#8230;] &#8212; that&#8217;s a whole different skill set. That&#8217;s a DevOps and IT skill set,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>What Streamlit for Teams does is take care of all that in the background for end users, so they can concentrate on the app building part of the equation without help from the technical side of the company to deploy it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Y5Lb2azStk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/31\/why-aws-is-building-tiny-ai-race-cars-to-teach-machine-learning\/\">Why AWS is building tiny AI race cars to teach machine learning<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why AWS is building tiny AI race cars to teach machine learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/31\/why-aws-is-building-tiny-ai-race-cars-to-teach-machine-learning\/embed\/#?secret=Y5Lb2azStk\" data-secret=\"Y5Lb2azStk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia, who is leading the firm&#8217;s investment in Streamlit, says that she was impressed with the company&#8217;s developer focus and sees the new commercial offering as a way to expand usage of the applications that data scientists have been building in the open source project.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Streamlit has a chance to define a better interface between data teams and business users by ushering in a new paradigm for interactive, data-rich applications,&#8221; Huang said.<\/p>\n<p>They have data scientists at big-name companies like Uber, Delta Dental and John Deere using the open source product already. They have kept the company fairly lean with 27 employees up until now, but the plan is to double that number in the coming year with the new funding, Kelly says.<\/p>\n<p>She says that the founding team recognizes that it&#8217;s important to build a diverse company. She admits that it&#8217;s not always easy to do in practice when as a young startup, you are just fighting to stay alive, but she says that the funding gives them the luxury to step back and begin to hire more deliberately.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Literally right before this call, I was on with a consultant who is going to come in and work with the executive team, so that we&#8217;re all super clear about what we mean [when it comes to] diversity for us and how is this actually a really core part of our company, so that we can flow that into recruiting and people and engineering practices and and make that a lived value within our company,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Streamlit for Teams is available in beta starting today.

labels to teach the machine learning model what it needs to know. <a href=\"http:\/\/snorkel.ai\">Snorkel AI<\/a> wants to make it easier for subject matter experts to apply those labels programmatically, and today the startup announced a $35 million Series B.<\/p>\n<p>It also announced a new tool called Applications Studio that provides a way to build common machine learning applications using templates and predefined components.<\/p>\n<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round with participation from previous investors Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel and Nepenthe Capital. New investors Walden and BlackRock also joined in. The startup reports that it has now raised $50 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Company co-founder and CEO Alex Ratner says that data labeling remains a huge challenge and roadblock to moving machine learning and artificial intelligence forward inside a lot of industries because it is costly, labor-intensive and hard for the subject experts to carve out the time to do it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The not so hidden secret about AI today is that in spite of all the technological and tooling advancements, roughly 80 to 90% of the cost and time for an average AI project goes into just manually labeling and collecting and relabeling this training data,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>He says that his company has developed a solution to simplify this process to make it easier for subject experts to programmatically add the labels, a process he says decreases the time and effort required to apply labels in a pretty dramatic way from months to hours or days, depending on the complexity of the data.<\/p>\n<p>As the company has developed this methodology, customers have been asking for help in the next step of the machine learning process, which is taking that training data and the model and building an application. That&#8217;s where the Application Studio comes in.\u00a0It could be a contract classifier at a bank or a network anomaly detector at a telco and it helps companies take that next step after data labeling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about how you programmatically label the data, it&#8217;s also about the models, the preprocessors, the post processors, and so we&#8217;ve made this now accessible in a kind of templated and visual no-code interface,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Ej7fbJPjg4\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/12\/datarobot-to-acquire-data-prep-startup-paxata\/\">DataRobot is acquiring Paxata to add data prep to machine learning platform<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;DataRobot is acquiring Paxata to add data prep to machine learning platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/12\/datarobot-to-acquire-data-prep-startup-paxata\/embed\/#?secret=Ej7fbJPjg4\" data-secret=\"Ej7fbJPjg4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The company&#8217;s products are based on research that began at the Stanford AI Lab in 2015. The founders spent four years in the research phase before launching Snorkel in 2019. Today, the startup has 40 employees. Ratner recognizes the issues that the technology industry has had from a diversity perspective and says he has made a conscious effort to build a diverse and inclusive company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What I can say is that we tried to prioritize it at a company level, the full team level and at a board level from day one, and to also put action behind that. So we&#8217;ve been working with external firms for internal training and audits and strategy around DEI, and we&#8217;ve made pipeline diversity, a non-negotiable requirement of any of our contracts with recruiting firms,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Ratner also recognizes that automation can hard code bias into machine learning models, and he&#8217;s hopeful that by simplifying the labeling process, it can make it much easier to detect bias when it happens.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you start with a dozen or two dozen of what we call labeling functions in Snorkel, you still need to be vigilant and proactive about trying to detect bias, but it&#8217;s easier to audit what taught your model to change it by just going back and looking at a couple of hundred lines of code.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"s5DloFonz8\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/31\/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021\/\">How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/31\/how-artificial-intelligence-will-be-used-in-2021\/embed\/#?secret=s5DloFonz8\" data-secret=\"s5DloFonz8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the more tedious aspects of machine learning is providing a set of labels to teach the machine learning model what it needs to know.

The Humm patch uses tACS (transcranial alternating stimulation) and in clinical research studies, the Humm patch saw a measurable (+~20%) improvement against placebo.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an interesting underlying technology, and the advisors &#8212; which include a number of university professors in the sciences &#8212; certainly see commercial potential. There are some lingering questions around tACS.<\/p>\n<p>Quoting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/electrical-brain-stimulation-may-alleviate-obsessive-compulsive-behaviors1\/\">Scientific American from January<\/a>: \u201cThe potential therapeutic effects of tACS on memory, food craving and other neural processes have been tested in dozens of studies in the past. Questions have been raised about whether this method actually exerts any meaningful changes in the brain, however.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Definitely interested in seeing more about this one and perhaps taking it for a spin when the product ships, later this year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/publica.la\/\"><span style=\"font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px;\">Publica<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ULZaZTvsUQs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As far as elevator pitches go, Publica may have the best one of the show. \u201cPublica is Shopify for Digital Content.\u201d Essentially, the company wants to be a direct conduit between content creators and consumers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPublica is a service that enables authors and content creators to have their own custom storefront to share, market and sell e-books, audiobooks and any other types of digital content with no intermediaries,\u201d CEO Pablo Laurino tells TechCrunch. \u201cIn the era of D2C and marketplaces, Publica helps authors and content to achieve that on their own storefront, offering authors complete control over their brand and ownership of the relationships.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The system helps creators make their own own digital storefront to sell a wide variety of products, including audiobooks and e-books.

So far, it has found success in particular in financial services, manufacturing, and business services, among other sectors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic served as a tailwind to its business. Sales teams generally rely on in-person interactions to stay productive, Schopmeyer points out.

approach to bringing music into the virtual world with his startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.authentic-artists.ai\">Authentic Artists<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>McGarry pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/14\/more-investors-are-betting-on-virtual-influencers-like-lil-miquela\/\">virtual celebrities like Lil Miquela<\/a> and virtual concerts like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/24\/fortnite-hosted-a-psychedelic-travis-scott-concert-and-12-3m-people-watched\/\">Travis Scott&#8217;s giant event in Fortnite<\/a> as setting the stage for Authentic Artists. In a sense, the startup represents a combination of those ideas, creating virtual musicians who perform their own concerts \u2014 initially in Twitch \u2014 and can respond to audience requests.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very intentionally not trying to create a digital facsimile of what already exists,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to use new tools to create new art, new experiences, new culture. The appeal is that these artists can really be vehicles for collaboration with the audience, so that [audience members] can selectively shape the live show.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In fact, Authentic Artists has already held some test concerts on Twitch, and McGarry said the team was &#8220;frankly, sort of blown away by the response,&#8221; with average watch time of 35 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>It will be unveiling its next generation of virtual artists in Twitch concerts starting on April 14, co-hosted by (human) Twitch streamers, who will introduce the concept to audiences \u2014 though McGarry said there&#8217;s potential for more collaboration between virtual and human stars in the future.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of different pieces to the Authentic Artists platform, working together to animate a virtual musician, generate their music and allow them to respond to audience feedback, whether that&#8217;s increasing the intensity of a song, decreasing the tempo or fast forwarding to the next song.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/531980169\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Music is the lifeblood of our vision, and accordingly, we&#8217;ve invested significantly in the core audio engine,&#8221; McGarry said. He emphasized that the platform is not simply recombining music loops composed by humans, but rather generating music on its own: &#8220;We want [our virtual artists] to have autonomy, we want them to be real.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It sounds like the team is still putting the final touches on the new artists, so I didn&#8217;t get to see a full concert experience. Instead, McGarry and his team presented renderings of these artists (including a half-human cyborg and a giant iguana) and their virtual venues, and they demonstrated the music engine, creating new compositions on-the-fly while adjusting different parameters. As McGarry put it, &#8220;These are all original compositions, generated and produced as we sit here, with no manual intervention.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Authentic Artists is backed by investors including OVO Fund, James Murdoch\u2019s Lupa Systems, Mixi Group and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park.

we&#8217;ve become accustomed to next- or same-day delivery. But the pandemic has also renewed our interest in buying from smaller businesses and retailers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.useswyft.com\/\">Swyft<\/a>, a company that has just raised $17.5 million in Series A, helps retailers of any size provide affordable same-day delivery. The round was co-led by Inovia Capital and Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Shopify and existing investors Golden Ventures and Trucks VC.<\/p>\n<p>Swyft is a marketplace, connecting a network of shipping carriers with vendors. But the company also provides software to those carriers to make them more efficient, and turns them into a vast network that allows them to pick up more inventory without adding to their infrastructure.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In other words, several regional carriers may play a part in delivering a parcel shipped via Swyft without making any big changes to their original routes or adding new drivers, trucks, etc.<\/p>\n<p>To date, major players in both shipping and retail have dominated this space, thanks in large part to their ability to deliver quickly. Swyft is looking to amass an army, for lack of a better term, comprised of all of the smaller players, including mom and pop retailers and vendors as well as smaller, regional carriers. Banded together through software, these carriers and retailers can match the scale and influence of the behemoths without spending a fortune.<\/p>\n<p>Swyft was cofounded by Aadil Kazmi (CEO), Zeeshan Hamid (Head of Engineering), and Maraz Rahman (Head of Sales). Kazmi and Hamid both spent their careers at Amazon, working on data and last-mile operations for the behemoth. Rahman was an early employee at a YC-backed proptech startup.<\/p>\n<p>The trio started asking themselves early last year why retailers weren&#8217;t able to offer same-day delivery and chose to tackle the gap they discovered.<\/p>\n<p>The key ingredient to Swyft is not its aggregation of couriers, but the software it provides to them. Because Swyft is increasing demand for these carriers, it also needs to make them more efficient. The back-end software allows carriers to digitize or automate a good deal of what they&#8217;re traditionally doing by hand.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Aadil Kazmi says that Swyft is able to come in anywhere between 25 and 30 percent cheaper than the incumbent option.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what percent of your purchases are from Amazon, but for me it&#8217;s like 150 percent,&#8221; said Eurie Kim. &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to buy elsewhere with the pandemic, and support local and independent brands, but Amazon&#8217;s trained us all to have fast and free shipping. It feels like an opportunity where the consumer experience is really lacking and the burden on merchants and retailers is extremely heavy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Swyft currently has 16 full-time employees. Twelve percent are female and 75 percent are people of color, according to the company.<\/p>\n<p>Since April 2020, Swyft has facilitated the delivery of more than 180,000 packages, and expanded gross margin from 78 percent to 82 percent, thanks in large part to revenue from the software side of the business and a zero-asset model.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thanks to major players like Amazon and Walmart, we&#8217;ve become accustomed to next- or same-day delivery.

a performance management tool for customer-facing teams and the individuals in them, raises $25M"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The longer we continue to work with either all or part of our teams in remote, out-of-physical-office environments, the more imperative it becomes for those teams to have some tools in place to keep the channels of communication and management open, and for the individuals in those teams to have a sense of how well they are performing. Today, one of the startups that provides a team productivity app with that in mind is announcing a round of funding to fuel its growth.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathlight.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathlight<\/a>, which has built a performance management platform for customer-facing teams &#8212; sales, field service and support &#8212; to help managers and employees themselves to track and analyze how they are doing, to coach them when and where it&#8217;s needed, and to communicate updates and more, has picked up $25 million &#8212; money that it will be using to continue growing its customer base and the functionality across its app.<\/p>\n<p>The funding is being led by Insight Partners, with previous backers Kleiner Perkins and Quiet Capital also participating, alongside Uncorrelated Ventures; Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of Yelp; David Glazer, CFO of Palantir; and Michael Ovitz, co-founder of CAA and Owner of Broad Beach Ventures. Pathlight has now raised $35 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Pathlight today provides users with a range of tools to visualize team and individual performance across various parameters set by managers, using data that teams integrate from other platforms like Salesforce, Zendesk and Outreach, among others.<\/p>\n<p>Using that data and specific metrics for the job in question, managers can then initiate conversations with individuals to focus in on specific areas where things need attention, and provide some coaching to help fix it. It can also be used to provide team-wide updates and encouragement, which sits alongside whatever other tools a person might use in their daily customer-facing work.<\/p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2135006,2135007,2135008,2135009,2135010\"]<\/p>\n<p>Since launching in March 2020, the startup has picked up good traction, with customers including Twilio, Earnin, Greenhouse, and CLEAR. But perhaps even more importantly, <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">the pandemic and resulting switch to remote work has underscored how necessary tools like Pathlight&#8217;s have become: the startup says that engagement on its platform has shot up 300% in the last 12 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Alexander Kvamme, the CEO of Pathlight, said that he first became aware of the challenges of communicating across customer-facing teams, and having transparency on how they are doing as individuals and as a group, when he was at Yelp. Yelp had acquired his startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/07\/18\/yelp-acquires-online-reservation-service-seatme\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reservations service SeatMe<\/a>, and used the acquisition to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/05\/13\/yelp-bites-back-at-opentable-tripadvisor-and-google-with-free-yelp-reservations-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build and run Yelp Reservations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>He was quick to realize that there weren&#8217;t really effective tools for him to see how individuals in the sales team were doing, how they were doing compared to goals the company wanted to achieve and based on the sales data they already had in other systems, how to work more effectively with people to communicate when something needed changing, and how to tailor all that in line with new variations in the formula &#8212; in their case, how to sell new products like a reservations service alongside advertising and other Yelp services for businesses.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s five or 3,000 people, the problem doesn&#8217;t go away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everyone uses their own systems, and it hurts front line employees when they don&#8217;t know how they are doing, or don&#8217;t get recognition when they are doing well, or don&#8217;t get coaching when they are not. Our thesis was that if software is eating the world, and you as a company are buying more software and analytics, over time managers will be more like data analysts. So we are providing a way for managers to be more data-driven.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Five years down the line, Kvamme got the bug again to start a company and decided to return to that problem, teaming up with co-founder Trey Doig, the engineer who designed SeatMe and then turned it into Yelp Reservations and is now Pathlight&#8217;s CTO.<\/p>\n<p>As they see it, the challenge has still not really been addressed. That&#8217;s not to say that there are not a number of companies &#8212; competitors to Pathlight &#8212; looking to fill that gap as well. Another people management platform called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/14\/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lattice last year picked up $45 million<\/a>\u00a0 (I&#8217;m guessing it will be raising money again around about now); HubSpot, Zoho, SalesLoft and a number of others also are taking different approaches to the same challenge: front-line customer-facing people spend the majority of their time and attention on interacting with people, and so there need to be better tools in place to help them figure out how to make that communication more effective, figure out what is working and what is not.<\/p>\n<p>And all of this, of course, is not at all new: it&#8217;s not like we all woke up one day and suddenly wanted to know how we are doing at work, or managers suddenly felt they needed to communicate with staff.<\/p>\n<p>What has changed, however, is <em>how<\/em> we work: many of us have not seen the inside of our offices for more than a year at this point, and for a large proportion of us, we may never return again, or if we do it will be under different circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>All of this means that some of the more traditional metrics and indicators of our performance, praising, management relationships, and learning from team mates simply is not there anymore.<\/p>\n<p>In customer-facing areas like sales, support and field service, that lack of contact may be even more acute, since many of the teams working in these environments have long relied on huddles and communication throughout the day, week and month to continuously tweak work and improve it. So while tools like Pathlight&#8217;s will be useful as data analytics provision for teams regardless of how we work, it can be argued that they are even more important right now.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think people have started to realize that if you can empower front line to be more independent, your numbers will go up and do better,&#8221; Kvamme said.<\/p>\n<p>This is part of what went into the investment decision made here.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the acceleration of digital transformation across the enterprise, it\u2019s not enough to rethink the way we work\u2014we must also rethink the way we manage,\u201d said Jeff Lieberman, MD at Insight Partners. \u201cPathlight is ushering in a new age of data-driven management, an ethos that we believe every enterprise will need to embrace\u2014quickly. We are excited to partner with the Pathlight team as they bring their powerful platform to companies across the world.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The longer we continue to work with either all or part of our teams in remote, out-of-physical-office environments, the more imperative it becomes for those teams to have some tools in place to keep the channels of communication and management open, and for the individuals in those teams to have a sense of how well [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13119829,"featured_media":2118385,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"4f7226dc-bc13-3351-bf26-d216c7bfc18c"},"categories":[449557044,576602978],"tags":[9273,103259,77740,7094],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/GettyImages-1215953761.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3utzO3t","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[13119829],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2134976"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2134976"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2134976\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2135083,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2134976\/revisions\/2135083"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/13119829"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2134976&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/13119829"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2118385"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2134976"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2135006"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2135007"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2135008"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2135009"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2135010"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2134976"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2134976"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2134976"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2134976"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2134976"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2134976"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":13119829,"name":"Ingrid Lunden","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ingrid-lunden\/","slug":"ingrid-lunden","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ingridlunden","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ingridlunden","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ingridlunden","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/ingrid-lunden"},"position":"Writer","cbDescription":"<p>Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Mike brings a specialized mindset to the broadest of goals: growth. He focuses on helping founders identify, maneuver, and systematize their growth levers. Having overseen both nine-figure marketing budgets (across both digital and offline channels) and scrappy product-oriented growth teams, Mike understands what both healthy and unhealthy growth look like. Prior to Greylock, Mike was the first in-house growth hire at Stitch Fix, where he built and led the Growth organization and developed a set of core operating principles that helped take the company through IPO. Before that, Mike was the first growth hire at Tilt, where he built and oversaw multiple teams, including analytics, marketing, community, and growth product. He also served on YC\u2019s growth advisory council, is a growth lecturer at Reforge, and was a growth advisor across various VC firms and startups.
